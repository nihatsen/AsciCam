Also, you can have fun with this program as using it as your webcam output via OBS.
(You can lower the "vertical" variable to increase FPS.)

## Configurating the code.

There are configuration variables that you can change between 129. and 135. lines.

### Meanings of the configuration variables.

```

    camera: Which camera to use? (As a number)
    mirrored: Mirror the camera. (1 or 0)
    vertical: Character number in a row.
    fontsize: Fontsize of the terminal for smooth views. (Doesn't work in linux, don't use "3" because it's buggy right now.)

    set_screen: Fitting the terminal into ascii characters. (0 is for true and 1 is for false.)
    char_list: Characters listed by their brightness.

```
